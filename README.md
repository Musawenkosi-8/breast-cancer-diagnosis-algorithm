Problem Definition Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women globally. Early and accurate detection of malignant tumors is essential for effective treatment and survival. The challenge is to build a reliable machine learning model that can automatically classify tumors as malignant or benign based on features derived from digitized medical images of fine-needle aspirates. The goal of this project is to: Analyze and explore breast cancer diagnostic data. Build and evaluate predictive machine learning models. Deploy the best-performing model for real-world use. Processes Data Acquisition Used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset from sklearn.datasets. 30 numeric features, 569 samples, labeled as malignant (0) or benign (1). Data Exploration Visualized feature distributions using histograms and countplots. Explored correlations using a heatmap. Analyzed class balance and important feature interactions using pairplots. Preprocessing Scaled features using StandardScaler to normalize input values. Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing subsets. Modeling Trained three models using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning: Logistic Regression Support Vector Machine Random Forest Classifier Selected the best model based on cross-validated accuracy and ROC AUC. Evaluation Used confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve for each model. Compared model performance using bar charts. Deployment Saved the best-performing model (Random Forest) and preprocessing scaler using joblib. Created a Streamlit web app for real-time prediction based on user input. Outcomes Achieved high classification accuracy (98%) on test data using a Random Forest Classifier. Malignant and benign tumors were clearly separable based on selected features like worst radius, mean concave points, and worst perimeter.
